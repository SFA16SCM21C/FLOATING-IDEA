# FLOATING-IDEA

Just a reference of my all thoughts and a log of them to help recollect

FREAKING IDEAS

- Is it possible to connect chatgpt with Siri or connect chatgpt with voice and display results on Chrome??
- Just like that book guy has started the dating thing, why not make such a similar thing for Indians in the US in cities?
- Create a db of people who got laid off using web scrapping and using LinkedIn openwork tags and collect their skills
- 


CRAFTY TYPES IDEAS
- Use chatgpt to make a plan for a small e-commerce business that sells customized bridesmaids' boxes? Use chatgpt to come up with a strategyItems could include a compact mirror, something something, use Pinterest to get some inspiration. You could make customizations on Harry Potter-inspired surprise boxes. Or gen shin inspired surprise boxes? Or you can customize on girl's nakhras? Or girls cute characteristics like mere nakhre vale, meri caring vali or use a different variety of something on girls mood basis maybe candles? Or explain your girl in adjectives and we make a surprise box for her. You cna also make them age-appropriate boxes too? Give your daughter a girl surprise box set. Could add ear cuff custom made for people in the gift box?

Check —— there are websites that customize items for you, check if they can customize a box of items for you. It completely stops you from doing in house business, all could be through websites only and email


Or best option for the laziest people that they can send people a link to set themselves up with a surprise box for themselves or like a gift to a family member or ike a gift t oa coworker???

Later releases if it works out, that you can have one poll to find out which category by cater they would like to choose to add a s a signature product for the company since you love and are very thankful to your customer base

Also as a brand if you want to itself your self later on you can make cards, gift wrappers that your brand will resent or based on the category of the gift being sent you can create categories gift bag wrappers??

You can also think of aiming different aspects at different crowd, for couples you can try to check another strategy like making a little game with the gifting boxes if it is for lovers, they can play a game together or make an solo game for each other.

You can also make reels based on movies doing good like tu jhooti me maker, and make toons as a post to attract customers also make reels out of those toons

One also early on idea could be sending people a comic version of peoples memory or you can do draw on pictures using ur iPad and make fun scribbles on it , he idea is tending towards the idea of pics as in pics in your cam and something and anything, make crowns on girls, or or team lunch team make them an army and pose like that, think of idea like that too

Business — Appreciation Boxes (AB)

Story - Gift Boxes ( contains a comic version of letter of a memory or appreciation for like team related or business related people)

——NOTHER BEST IDEA —— INDIA ME POSTMAN BAND HO GYE HAI, SO LET US BE YOUR DAKIYA (BUSINESS NAME COULD ALSO BE DAKIYA OR SIMILAR, NOW SEND LETTERS WITH POSTMAN VALI TYPE KI CHITTHI FOR OLD VERSIONS OF MEMORIES OR SNEDING YOUR GIRLFRIENDS LIKE THAT,, SOUNDS LIEK A GOOD MARKET FOR SMALL SCALE GIFTS TOO, MIANLY ITS GONNA BE )

—OR DAKIYA FOR OLD PEOPLE TARGET — COMIC VALA YOUNG PEOPLE TARGET

Promotional - employee welcome kit

Also you can target the gift boxes by that customizations, that how you scale


You can start with Unknown Company name and market it like where customer can decide what will be the company name,

Start testing the website by using a letter to send my brother and my friends

Launch phase one as chat group — launch phase two as unknown box or a fixed box — then launch as your own branch and something later or a app

Option 1 - …send a love box to your person (LOVE)
Option 2 -…send love box anonymously (COMPLICATED)
Option 3 - …send appreciation box (CHERISH)
Option 4 - …send respect box (RESPECT)

Options - Respect/Appreciation Boxes or His/Her Boxes

You can also add a mobile phone long customized mood board and send the jpeg or something like that with some words describing how the person describes your vibe - its easy to do
Another digital art idea, the location of their date or something a digitized version of that location if they want

Later denim corset? Or a barbie doll dressed in their attire

Cake toppers?

Customized cake toppers. Nice

Proposal box, anniversary box, bridesmaid, groomsmen, poeople checking in hotel box, gift box, bride groom box, guide gudiya ka keel or ken and barbie style, or cake topper style

Indian barbie, bride barbie, mother barbie, grandma barbie, wife barbie

Glass painting that acrylic types for anime or wedding signs

Lego pieces sent as a kit or sent as a custom gift box of the pieces displayed in between the box for a groom example

Olive and Popeye lego ox

Miniature house kits/gift box

Or you can accumulate your customs ones and make a big doll house, you can piece together different vibes of rooms together n then ask local worker to change it local to outsourced

Remember the miniature ideas you have stored in your Pinterest board, you can also use the miniature garden ideas to make your own customized one after taking some time

Now you have an I deal of how many things you can customize and add in your box,

Also saw bts cards, add it in a bts inspired box

Damnnnnn, black pink inspired box

Have a bts contest in Delhi and pick up few followers and send them bts customized boxes for promotion

Now cards introduced, now you customize cards for people

Crystal chick introduction/customize
Evil eye suncatcher/customize

Kancha set? For fun

Big crystal on a acrylic stand or something like that/customize

Anime crystal ball? (Like the pikachu one)

Denim jacket, or fringe jacket, denim white fur jacket, look from this recommendation - https://www.alibaba.com/trade/search?spm=a2700.galleryofferlist.0.0.215b6ef1FpqRXg&SearchScene=themePage&themeScene=intelligentRecommendation&themeIds=107029221,107029039,107029439&sceneId=101001501&SearchText=denim+jackets&themeId=107029439&themeName=intelligentRecommendation:Trending%20Products%20with%20High%20Market%20Potential

Another customized medals, pasta custom too and for different types, like for being proud of me/you, proud you being your daughter, etc (metal medal also instagram or Pinterest would show u ideas for customization)

With denim, think of his/her box (take local first into consideration to make one for you then customize and large scale)

Next idea, bracelet one by one and then introduce friendship set on friends day or girls, for boys lets see a car collection or pick one of those, and use cushions to introduce your set/customize large scale later

Try customize box of flowers too with a customized item or a message I center, try this bouquet or box of flowers thing in local first, or gallons or something just an idea loose idea does not sound feasible so first local try

For mom and dad an idea, a set of hankies customized for an occasion or celebration, first try customization of one hanky

Our mascot could be a mitt and a fancy dakiya who’s retired niceeeeeee who listen to peoples story and send them blessings bcz its their goal (could be any story that’s when you show the comic version of it while in a conversion you goooo zoom to next screen)

Once a milestone release a character out of the ideas you have crafted using a poll and add them to your family on your main landing page, use the poll to decide on a winner in each category, keep growing like that

— first ever family member are gong to be anda and chill / piggy YOU can also think of putting them as your mascots, you shower and you as first icons and then dakiya - sushi or shelly, mitt tamari akshita

For your first ever launch customer who got you 20 orders to launch them on website I have an idea, use the dakiya to flash the mittu in the dark, looking for a person to give them the lift at a deserted area, you wait and wait….and then when you finally do find someone who ordered you show them coming to your rescue in some way introduce them based on their vibe and just say, heyyyyy! And end the episode

best idea is those wrapping paper if you need make them 4 pastels shades based on your first 4 order color palette and then again zoom into the box —— think

Always while customizing put the wrapping in one type of design based on custom same goes for the box, and then release 4 colors during bulk and same for boxes

Later for bulk, do one thing let mitt and dakiya choose items upto 1-10 and make their own box, or when item becomes too much —— new idea to group them into categories, choose your main piece and then what you want to say or what you them to feel or some aadhar satkaar or company thing

Shelly and akshita 30 comics - LOVE
Akshita and cousins 15+15 parents comics - FAMILY
Akshita and Friends for a THANK YOU or celebration - FRIENDSHIP
People and Boss - APPRECIATION (Teamwork n all)
Or ask them to send you voice notes of what they wanted to say/feel to the person and sending what reason

Find their top 10 items they would want to gift each other in this one moth to apologize or to say whatever they expressed

Top 1 from all 4, then you continue customs

Organize online parties and send people a scheduled invitation if you want to show your mascot or something, YouTube live for launch events or something, if you want to custom it to send invitations to people on your behalf for virtual hangout also make sure you ask them accept on terms ond condition

Mithhu is a principal of school where he allows people to be free and expressive, mitt is waiting to welcome his first student, first client….that how also you can start the story when you bulk up

If it’s been days then you can go with mitts n a trip to find your customer in Delhi using mithhu as ur social presence..if its been too much time after bulk, you can show mithhu roaming around doing things they wanna do, but they always end up waking up from the dream after the dream ends, suddenly one day they received a ping, then mithhu and dakiya or whoever ran and ran n reached finally to hear their story

Bestttttt----- use and n piggy as a story friends, mithhu and dakiya to portray your social presence, toon is on and n piggy friends, they become friends with butler and mithhu who help them run the school

Make custom Spotify playlist for a theme???? And add it in package?? First start it in the customized cell wallpaper and see how people react

Customized digital copy of their Pinterest characters as a Spotify song of their choice, can be printed too, later introduce an album that you can store it in or fridge magnets whatever they want it to be customized to ——— also a deck of card like box, or in polaroid form check price

Customized masala jars, maybe even do ceramic coffee sugar and tea boxes, then customize

Customize high end dresses??

Take inspiration Pinterest of the houses you want to have do miniature versions of them and make a big house out of it like a big doll house that’s how you sell it

How about customized coffee pods of the South Indian coffee for events and big set or something

You can also introduce customized items as a set of four with boxing in shades of same color in increasing or decreasing and then biggest bouflower on top

Comic idea - one day mittu and butler watched KUWK and got addicted to it, or got addicted to

Customize that vintage words gala corset with flowers on to and add the green yellow pants that you have on your mood board

Leather collared corset or pinstripes collared corset with buttons, shiny pants or Lacey pants with pants like buttons - adore inspired heels or pink or green adore inspired heels kittens types

Customized keyboards niceeeeeeeee

Another comic idea is comic of the Indian old died romantic couples who gives advices to people who are in trouble or who have something to say since they were an expert of Indian love , the land where love exists in many forms ???

- A google extension or a website?? To preschedule to default limit or til la year long calendar to send emails or something like that virtually on behalf of a company or a person  or to entire official or client business circle as a reach out email—— a total scheduling kinda technical side business
